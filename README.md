### [About the Challenge](https://forum.enterprisedna.co/t/challenge-20-sales-production-analysis/25736/2)

## Overview:

I was provided one excel sheet containing different workbooks : Actual Production, Production & Sales Forecast, Sales Orders, Finished Goods Inventory, Products 
and Machines. These sheets contains details about production of different products, details about different types of machine, Forecast type and Units for them,
quantity of sales done over a period of time and in a day, etc.

## Requirements of the report:

### Tools Used: Power BI, Figma, Logomakr.com

After loading the dataset in Power BI, I applied the following applications...

## Understanding of Data:
Primarily, main focus was here to analyse the production and sales made by AIKEEN INDUSTRIES. The main point was to analyze relevant KPIs through which the report could
be made. 
During the analysis, key objectives which could be answered including the requirements of the client:
* Machine-Wise Production: Contribution to production made by different types of machines.
* Product Production: Quantity of production of different products.
* Sales and Production Forecast Units
* Terms: Accuracy of Forecast, Sell Through Rate and Fill Rate
* Quantity of products consumed in a day
* Shift-wise production analysis

## Application of DAX measures:
During the making of the dashboard, I applied several DAX measures. For terms to calculate which were Accuracy of Forecast, Sell Through Rate and Fill Rate, I applied
the DAX measures according to the formula given to me.
I applied the other measures too to calculate Total Quantity of Sales and Total Production Quantity.

## Visualization in Power BI:
I splitted the report in 4 pages namely "Overview", "Production & Forecasting", "Sales & Forecasting", "Insights & Recommendations".

### Theme and Color Palette:
* Used dark theme for the dashboard.
* Colors Used: Green, Orange, Black and Blue

### Visualization:
Here, I used Figma for creating the layout for background with ratio 16:9 with 720*1280px

## Conclusion:
Overall, it was a good dataset to visualize and it improved my understanding of DAX measures and visualization techniques.
